# 🎨 Dixit Scoreboard

A simple app to track scores during your Dixit board game sessions.
Built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

# 🧙‍♀️ Inspiration
Inspired by the joy of playing Dixit with friends — now with easier score tracking ✨

Dixit is a favorite in my friend group, and we play it often. But carrying the game box and scoreboard around
— especially on holidays or hiking trips — isn’t always practical. After one too many games scribbled on napkins,
and a friend saying, “You’re an engineer, right? Surely you can create an app for this!” — I finally built a simple web app
to make score tracking easy wherever we are.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Add & remove players
- ➕ Increment and decrement scores
- 🎯 Clean and responsive UI
- 🧠 No sign-in, no storage — just quick and simple scorekeeping
